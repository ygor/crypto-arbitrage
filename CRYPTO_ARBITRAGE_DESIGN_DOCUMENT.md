# Crypto Arbitrage System - Design Document

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** Current Implementation Review & Future Roadmap

---

## Executive Summary

The Crypto Arbitrage System is a real-time cryptocurrency trading platform designed to detect and execute profitable price differences across multiple exchanges. The system has undergone significant architectural evolution, recently transitioning from a React-based frontend to a Blazor Server implementation, representing a fundamental shift toward a unified .NET ecosystem.

### Key Findings from Critical Review

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Clean architecture implementation with proper domain separation
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (Unit, Integration, E2E)
- ✅ Modern .NET 9 implementation with current best practices
- ✅ Production-ready containerization with Docker Compose
- ✅ Robust exchange abstraction supporting multiple providers (Coinbase, Kraken)
- ✅ Sophisticated risk management and paper trading capabilities

**Critical Issues Identified:**
- ⚠️ **Architectural Inconsistency**: Mixed API models and domain models causing duplication
- ⚠️ **Infrastructure Gaps**: Missing Terraform deployment automation
- ⚠️ **Documentation Debt**: API specifications directory empty, limited deployment guides
- ⚠️ **Testing Reliability**: WebSocket testing infrastructure needs improvement
- ⚠️ **Monitoring Gaps**: Limited observability and metrics collection
- ⚠️ **Blazor Property Mapping**: Known issues with model alignment between domain and UI

**Business Impact:**
- Current system can detect arbitrage opportunities but has limited production deployment automation
- Paper trading mode provides safe testing environment
- Real-time capabilities via SignalR enable responsive user experience
- Architecture supports extension to additional exchanges

### Current Architecture Assessment

**Adherence to Clean Architecture: ✅ Excellent**
- Clear separation of concerns across layers
- Domain layer remains independent
- Dependency injection properly implemented
- Interface segregation well applied

**Design Patterns Implementation:**
- ✅ Repository Pattern (IArbitrageRepository)
- ✅ Factory Pattern (IExchangeFactory)
- ✅ Strategy Pattern (Risk profiles, execution strategies)
- ✅ Observer Pattern (Event-driven architecture)
- ✅ CQRS concepts (Read/Write separation)
