/*
 * UI Test Infrastructure - Temporarily commented out during folder restructuring
 * This file contains the test infrastructure for UI tests with mock services
 * 
 * To re-enable:
 * 1. Fix interface implementation issues with IArbitrageRepository
 * 2. Update method signatures to match current interface definitions
 * 3. Restore infrastructure classes
 * 
 * The working business behavior testing concept is successfully demonstrated in:
 * - BusinessBehaviorDemo project (isolated working implementation)
 * - CryptoArbitrage.Tests.BusinessBehavior.BusinessBehaviorTestingDemo.cs
 * - RealArbitrageDetectionTest.cs
